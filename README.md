# Node.js-Express Real Time RESTful API Project 🚀💬

### https://jsonserver.reactbd.com/

## Project Overview 🌟
Hello everyone! Today we're going to create a **RESTful API** using **Node.js** and deploy it to **Vercel**. This API will feature multiple endpoints such as phones, phone cases, accessories, and watches, providing a comprehensive data structure for users. 📱🛒⌚

In this project, we will demonstrate how to fetch data from these endpoints, interact with the server, and implement real-time features. 🚀💻
